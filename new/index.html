				<p class='title' id='why'>Why I Started Dungeons and Newbies</p>
					<p class='paragraph'>I started the Dungeons and Newbies Podcast because I love Dungeons and Dragons, and I know first hand how difficult it can be to get into this fantastic game. I know this because I had to teach myself how to play; I purchased the Fifth Edition D&D Starter Set, and I had to teach myself with the help of a friend who, like me, had never played D&D before. Together we worked together reading through the rulebook that came with the Starter Set and taught ourselves the game. I don't want anyone else to have to be in that situation, so I want to use this podcast to inform people how to play and run the game. To start off, we need to know the lingo that goes with Dungeons and Dragons, which is why I devoted the first episode of this podcast to the different words you will hear and what you need for a game of D&D. Since then, I have spent episodes talking about some tips for Dungeon Masters, how to be a good player, and many more topics. I started this podcast to help people play the game and to share my ideas about the game I love so dearly.</p>

				<p class='title' id='what'>What is Dungeons&Newbies</p>
					<p class='paragraph'>Dungeons and Newbies is a podcast aimed at teaching people how to play Dungeons and Dragons, and to help them do so. Dungeons and Dragons is an immensely complicated game if you are brand new to it; however, I would like to make it easier for a newcomer to dip their toes in this fantastic hobby. In this podcast I give my opinions on different topics in Dungeons and Dragons, I discuss how I like to approach a problem, and how I run and play the game. My goal with this podcast is to ensure that even someone who has only heard of the game can approach a group feeling confident that they will be able to play the game and have fun.</p>

				<p class='title' id='host'>Meet the Host</p>
					<p class='paragraph'>I am Jack, I run the Dungeons and Newbies Podcast. I currently run one game of Dungeons and Dragons and play in a different group. I have more experience as a Dungeon Master; however, I do love to play I think it is a unique way to think about the world. As a Dungeon Master, I am not perfect; I have many things that I would like to work on when I'm running the game, but my players have fun, so that's great. I have played D&D since October of 2016, and I have only ever run 5th edition. I have read through a few things from previous editions and implemented them into my 5th edition games. I love to world build and create towns that are more than meets the eye. I am currently a freshman in college and am looking to become a voice actor. If you have any questions about my podcast or about me (please no personal information) send an email to <a href='mailto:Jack@DungeonsAndNewbies.com'>Jack@DungeonsAndNewbies.com</a>. Thank you for your interest in the Dungeons and Newbies Podcast!</p>

				<p class='title' id='equipment'>Equipment Used</p>
					<p class='paragraph'>The Dungeons and Newbies Podcast uses some fantastic gear. Let's start at the beginning, first, we write all the scripts in Microsoft Word, some pretty standard stuff. Next, when I go to record, he uses an Audio Technica AT2035, the guests all use their own mics. In the future, I'd like to get a few other microphones, so myself and my guests all have amazing audio quality. My microphone runs into a Behringer Xenyx 502 mixer which is plugged into a Behringer U-Phoria UMC22 interface. That interface is then connected into my laptop running Adobe Audition. The headphones I use are the Audio Technica ATH-M50X headphones.</p>
